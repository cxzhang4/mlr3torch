\title{Materialize Lazy Tensor Columns}
\usage{
materialize(x, device = "cpu", ...)
}
\description{
This will materialize all columns from a \code{data.frame} containing \code{\link[=lazy_tensor]{lazy_tensor()}} columns.
}
\details{
Caching is applied to ensure that each batch from the datasets wrapped by the lazy tensors is only loaded once.
It is also ensured that each graph is only applied once to a given input batch, i.e. different columns
can share the same graph, dataset and indices but point to different outputs.
